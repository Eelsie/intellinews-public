At the beginning of \\nthe government term, the economic situation will be weakened by rising prices and \\ninterest rates, which will reduce private demand and increase general government costs. \\nStrengthening household purchasing power and large investments related to sustainable \\ngrowth will boost economic growth starting next year.\\nThe structural problems of the Finnish economy are weak productivity growth and low \\nproductive investment. Productivity growth is held back by the relatively low level of \\nresearch and development activity and the lower level of education of young people \\nthan in other advanced industrialised countries. Although the employment rate has risen \\nsignificantly in recent years, the unemployment rate remains high and there is a shortage \\nof skilled labour.\\nOver the last fifteen years or so, the general government debt ratio has risen significantly. \\nThe deterioration in the dependency ratio has led to public sector expenditure growing \\nfaster than revenue, creating a large structural deficit in general government finances. \\nExpenditure related to population ageing will continue to grow in the coming years and \\ndecades. In addition to this, a rise in the level of debt together with higher interest rates \\nwill increase central government debt servicing expenditure significantly. In the coming \\nyears, general government finances will also be burdened by a number of substantial \\nsecurity-related procurement items.

The Government’s employment and \\ngrowth measures, together with direct adjustment measures, will create the conditions for \\nbalanced general government finances in 2031.\\nThe permanent structural imbalance between expenditure and revenue in general \\ngovernment finances is an acute problem.

Between 2025 and 2027, the distribution obligation will be \\nmoderately increased so that it will be 16.5 per cent in 2025, 19.5 per cent in 2026 and 22.5 \\nper cent in 2027.

The \\nimpact of the increase in the distribution obligation between 2025 and 2027 will be \\ncompensated for in several ways, including by using the flexibility mechanism in the \\ndistribution obligation, by including transport electricity in the distribution obligation and \\nby lowering the taxes on fuels, with a focus on easing the tax on the renewable fraction to \\nthe extent possible.\\nTransport electricity at public charging points will be included in the distribution \\nobligation in the same way as biogas and synthetic electric fuels. This means that the \\nincreased use of transport electricity, synthetic electric fuels and biogas will reduce the \\nneed for the traditional renewable fraction in fulfilling the distribution obligation. In \\naddition, as new fuels are gradually replacing traditional diesel and petrol, the distribution \\nobligation will be fulfilled by a smaller absolute amount of renewable fuel in tonnes, \\nwhich will reduce the risk of escalating the supply problems.\\nAn opportunity will be created for fuel sellers subject to the distribution obligation to fulfil \\nthe obligation by financing other emissions reductions. Emissions reductions financed \\nwith the flexibility mechanisms included in the distribution obligation must be targeted \\nto the non-emissions trading sectors. Measures concerning the effort sharing sector will \\nbe prioritised, but efforts will be made to extend the mechanism to a limited extent to \\nmeasures in the land use sector as well, based on an analysis to be conducted on the \\nmatter. The distribution obligation concerning renewable fuels will also be kept at a \\nreasonable level with respect to fuel oil, and a level of flexibility will be enabled between \\nthe distribution obligation for transport fuels and fuel oil in order to minimise costs.\\nThere is a risk that, as the distribution obligations rises, the price of the emission \\nreductions to be achieved will be higher than that of the alternative emission reduction \\nmeasures. This risk will be restricted by adjusting the level of the penalty fee related to \\nnon-compliance with the distribution obligation with respect to the agreed rise in the \\ndistribution obligations in the coming years.

Good \\nfunctional capacity is essential for older people’s wellbeing and their ability to keep living \\nat home.\\nPhysical inactivity poses a major challenge for all Western countries. The wellbeing of too \\nmany Finns is threatened by inactive lifestyles, which lead to reduced functional capacity. \\nOnly one in three children and young people and one in four adults engage in enough \\nphysical activity to stay healthy. Around 40 per cent of students have a level of physical \\ncapacity that makes daily life more difficult. Insufficient physical activity affects people’s \\nability to study and cope at work. It also poses a threat to maintaining national defence \\ncapability and keeping up general wellbeing. Physical inactivity is also a problem for the \\nnational economy. Various programmes and measures have been implemented over the \\nyears, but a comprehensive and cross-administrative approach will be needed to reverse \\nthis trend.\\nResearch evidence on the effects of physical activity on health, wellbeing and functional \\ncapacity is undeniable.

More and more matters of working life are agreed upon where things are best known, i.e. at workplaces. The ambitious family leave reform will especially improve the position of women in the labor market. In the future, you can flexibly combine work with studying or starting a business and with your own family situation. Even those outside the working life have opportunities to do and participate. For us, taxation is a tool that enables people's well-being and the wheels of society to run. Taxes are people's money, and we want to share only what is necessary. This is how we encourage you to do more. Instead of work and effort, we tax more emissions and harm. We use taxation to combat climate change. A fair society offers everyone the tools to build a good life. It is equality of opportunity. Everyone can also trust that in a difficult place, society and safety nets will support and help them get back on their feet.

We reduce labor taxation fairly in all income categories.  Tax relief, if targeted correctly, increases economic growth and encourages work, through which the state gets back part of the price of the tax sale. We do not reduce taxation to debt. We are shifting the focus of taxation from the taxation of work and entrepreneurship to the taxation of harm, emissions and consumption.  9.

This is the electoral platform of the National Coalition Party, but we’d rather call it a worksheet. Right now it feels like the time for empty rhetoric is over, and it’s time to act. It’s time to roll up our sleeves and get to work.  Everyone’s welcome, because Finland is our common cause.  1. We will turn the tide of Finnish economy and standard of living  The standard of living and purchasing power in Finland will increase, and people will still have money left to make their dreams come true. The National Coalition Party knows the formula for growth. We want to relieve the regulations of market economy and remove the obstacles to entering the markets.    The 10-point worksheet of the National Coalition Party:   1. We will put the preconditions of economic growth in Finland in order. We’ll drive investments in Finland and improve the competitiveness of our economy based on the National Coalition Party’s formula for growth. We’ll work in even closer cooperation with Finnish cities, municipalities and regions to create growth. 2. We will improve the preconditions for Finnish entrepreneurship. We’ll make sure companies have a supportive, stable and predictable operating environment and taxation. We’ll make it easier to invest in Finland and ensure smooth permit processes.  3. We will improve export opportunities for Finnish companies. We’ll continue expanding the European single market and freeing international trade to improve Finland’s export opportunities. We’ll decrease our dependency on dictatorships. 4. We will implement a programme for fair competition. We’ll remove obstacles to entering the market, increase competition between companies, and relieve regulations and unnecessary norms to lower consumer prices. We’ll reform alcohol policies, railway competition, gambling systems and public procurement, as well as relieve pharmacy regulations in the spirit of responsible market economy. 5. We will improve the opportunities for Finns to get wealthier. We’ll expand the ﬁeld of application for investment savings accounts, remove their maximum investment limit, and introduce investment savings accounts for newborns. We’ll improve the preconditions of ownership by launching a national ownership program.  6. We will ﬁx traQic connections everywhere in Finland. Functional connections within and from Finland are vital in terms of economic growth and security of supply. We’ll pay oQ repair debt on road and rail networks and see to sea and air connections.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/HS_DATA/Dataset3_TextA_National_Coalition_Party_election_program_2023.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

We will take up on the opportunities of digitalisation and data economy. We’ll push growth by promoting the data skills and digitalisation of SMEs, as well as investments in fast connections, research and product development. We’ll make sure we have nation-wide communication infrastructure. We’ll improve public services through digitalisation and provide data on the public sector to support the creation of new innovations. 8. We will reform the housing policy in Finland. We’ll reduce homelessness by reserving publicly funded rental housing to those who need them the most. We’ll control the cost development of housing by increasing the supply of plots and housing. We’ll reform the housing allowance system and land use and building regulations. We’ll increase cooperation between government and cities. 9. We will improve the competitiveness of Finnish food production. We’ll ensure the security of supply and food security. People must have safe, healthy and sustainably produced Finnish food available to them. Agriculture must be developed to become more competitive and viable and be more based on entrepreneurship.

We wish to strengthen economic growth and create new jobs, increase productivity in both the private and public sectors, as well as prioritise and decrease public expenditure.   The 10-point worksheet of the National Coalition Party:   1. We will balance public expenses and revenue. We’ll write an economic recovery programme lasting two parliamentary terms to balance public ﬁnances in Finland and stop indebtedness by 2031. 2. We will lower the total tax rate in Finland. Taxation in Finland is already heavy. Instead of increasing taxes, we’ll balance ﬁnances through growth and employment measures and by curbing expenditure. 3. We will prioritise public expenditure. When making decisions on balancing ﬁnances, all avenues are investigated, but we will avoid cutting from education and culture expenses, expenses critical to increasing employment and growth, as well as national defence and security expenses. 4. If we add to expenses, we will save somewhere else. Tax cuts would be ﬁnanced primarily by cutting expenses and by increasing taxes least detrimental to employment and growth.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/HS_DATA/Dataset3_TextA_National_Coalition_Party_election_program_2023.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

For example, we’ll promote free municipality experiments, make use of digitalisation, speed up processes, and direct resources from administration to action and services. This saves working hours and improves coping at work. 6. We will increase employment up to 80 per cent by 2030. By following the action plan of the National Coalition Party, a 100.000 Finns will gain employment during the next parliamentary term. We’ll remove obstacles to working, reform the labour market and invest in well-being at work.  7. We will make it proﬁtable to work under all circumstances. We’ll reform taxation and social security and remove inactivity traps, so that at least half of each Euro earned through work remains with the worker.  8. We will relieve the taxation of labour in all income brackets. When allocated correctly, tax cuts promote economic growth and encourage employment, thus returning some of the price of the tax cuts to the government. We will not make tax cuts to incur debt. We’ll transfer the focus of taxation from labour and entrepreneurs to harms, emissions and consumption.  9. We will reform Finnish working life and labour markets. We’ll increase contractual freedom in all workplaces. We’ll promote good labour relations in our society. We’ll create a sliding scale for earnings-related unemployment beneﬁts and expand it to include everyone. We’ll improve work ability, well-being at work and equality in working life. 10. We will speed up international recruitment. The working age population in Finland grows smaller as the number of elderly people increases. This equation challenges the very foundation of our well-being. We’ll relieve the bureaucracy involved in international recruitment. We’ll make sure people have easy access to work in Finland and that work permits are granted swiftly.  3. We will turn Finland into a superpower of clean, aAordable and reliable energy  The National Coalition Party wants Finland to become a superpower of clean, aQordable and reliable energy, so that Finnish households and companies don’t run out of electricity in the dead of winter. We need energy to keep our lights on, our houses warm and our companies running. With the same clean energy, Finland can attract energy intensive industries and jobs.

We’ll reform the electricity market and pricing model to be fairer, so that households and companies have smaller electricity bills. The most expensive production of electricity shouldn’t determine the price of all electricity. We’ll make sure aQordable, clean and Finnish electricity doesn’t run out even in the dead of winter. 2.

We’ll protect the Baltic Sea and Finnish waterways, forests and wetlands. We’ll support the Forest Biodiversity Programme (METSO) and the Helmi habitats programme. We’ll reduce the nutrient pollution causing the eutrophication of the Baltic Sea.  5. We will invest in clean energy. We’ll promote the use of wind and solar power.

We’ll commit to granting positive decisions in principle to all nuclear power projects that meet the safety requirements. We’ll remove the obstacles to building small nuclear reactors. We’ll make sure to have incentives for investing in and maintaining secure electricity consumption. 7. We will strengthen Finland’s energy self-suQiciency. Better self-suQiciency will improve Finland’s security of supply and safety, as well as the competitiveness of domestic industries. 8. We will streamline the zoning and permit processes of energy investments. We’ll give a permit guarantee to energy projects that are critical to Finland’s security of supply and safety. These projects will be given the highest priority in zoning, permit and appeals processes. 9. We will promote the generalisation of electricity demand response. We’ll encourage and, if necessary, obligate electricity suppliers to oQer contracts where the stability of a ﬁxed price is combined with the chance to save money by reducing consumption during peak hours.  10. We will develop energy storage and power transmission grids. We’ll make sure Finland is ready for hydrogen energy economy and that Finnish companies are equipped to thrive in global hydrogen markets. We’ll create a national hydrogen economy strategy for Finland. We’ll improve the power transmission grid within Finland and the Nordic countries.  4.

Ultimately it comes \\ndown to you and me – all of us who live in this fine land – being able to feel safe in our daily lives and enjoying good health today, tomorrow and in the future. \\n \\nThe world is changing. Superpowers are competing for supremacy. There are au -\\nthoritarian nations in which democracy is \\na curse word, which want to attack us here \\nin the West. They are working to splinter us and to weaken the EU. We shall not let that happen. The world order has been perma -\\nnently redrawn in terms of security policy. \\nIt is important to keep the right company.\\n Finland has many strengths: we are known for our reliability, stable institutions, equal -\\nity and good schools. But we can do better. We are burdened by rising debt and a labour shortage. For the SFP the roadmap is clear: we must build on our strengths and create solutions for tackling our weaknesses. \\n \\nAs a liberal, centre-right party, SFP works across the board to achieve a stable, modern Finland that defends the freedom of the in -\\ndividual and every person’s equal value. We say no to hate speech and racism. We will never promote division and polarisation. We want to build society through participation and dialogue.\\n \\nParliamentary elections will be held in Fin -\\nland on 2 April 2023. The elections will play a huge role in determining the direction our \\ncountry will take in the next four years. The \\nCovid pandemic left marks, not only finan -\\ncially, but also in our health and wellbeing. Our children and our elderly need special attention now. We want you to rely on a health care system that works when you need it, and to enjoy wellbeing at work. Our \\ncompanies need an incentivising environ -\\nment in which they can operate and grow. \\nIt should always be more profitable to work than to not. We must strengthen Finland’s \\ncompetitiveness in order to attract further \\ninvestment and, thereby, jobs. The cli -\\nmate crisis must be taken very seriously. Solutions are needed nationally as well as globally.\\n \\nWe want our children and grandchildren to swim in a clean Baltic Sea.

To vote is to have an influence. And your vote counts. During the current parlia -\\nmentary term, SFP has demonstrated that we are needed in the Finnish government. We have worked constructively and built bridges. We have achieved results. Finland is now on its way into NATO, something we \\nhave pushed for.

KD has published its own presentation to correct the problems of the social security system and the funding model of welfare areas. The Christian Democrats' medicines for a healthier Finland are investment in basic services, prevention and health promotion, quick access to treatment and sufficient human resources. Treatment must be obtained on a one-stop basis so that the customer's situation is considered as a whole. The development of patient information systems supports these goals. In order to break up treatment queues and meet future treatment needs, the public sector needs parallel private and third sector services. Through the coil reimbursement system for private care, the availability of social security services is improved and treatment queues are shortened; therefore, the system must be maintained and developed, for example by combining payment ceilings. The current separate payment ceilings for medicines, customer fees and trips are burdensome and bureaucratic for those who are very sick. Continuity and permanence must be increased in care relationships, which have been researched to improve the quality of care, reduce the need for and costs of healthcare services, and increase patient satisfaction. Those who need a lot of social security services benefit the most from a personal doctor or personal care system.

Restoring the honor of education Parents have the primary responsibility for education, they also know their children best. Families' situations are individual. The Christian Democrats trust that families are best able to decide whether a child participates in early childhood education in a kindergarten, family day care, or whether he spends his first years at home with a parent or, say, a grandparent. From society's point of view, home care for children is an affordable option, and it should not be made difficult. Different options are needed. The participation of children with immigrant backgrounds in early childhood education is important from the point of view of integration. The best way to improve the quality of early childhood education is by increasing human resources. Early childhood education group sizes must be reduced. Even at the moment, not all daycare centers meet the ratios regarding the number of children and educators required by law. More educated workforce and better working conditions are needed in order to maintain the attractiveness and retention of the industry. In addition, quality criteria must be introduced in early childhood education.

Likewise, the VAT treatment of investments must be corrected to be equal for private schools. Extending compulsory schooling has not solved the problems of secondary education.

Enterprising Finland The economy is an enabler of life and well-being, a tool. Christian democratic thinking about the economy does not look at society primarily from the point of view of euros, but from the point of view of human well-being and economic relations. The most important production factor in the economy is a healthy person. Economic policies for the coming government period The entire economic system is based on relationships and trust. The responsibility for life and the well-being of the community belongs to all of us. However, the structures of the economy are also of great importance for well-being. The healthier the relationships in society and the more trust and responsibility there is, the better the economy works. Problems in human relationships are reflected as nausea, which weakens resources, financial activity and creativity. Without families, locality and civil society, individuals are easily at the mercy of either the public sector or large corporations. Without functioning family relationships, children's well-being deteriorates. Without appreciation of nature, we destroy the conditions for life. The global economic and monetary system is in a difficult-to-foresee transition. Finland can influence the megatrends of the global economy to a very limited extent. It is necessary to prepare to adapt to the conditions of weak economic growth, rising prices, growing unemployment and weakening public finances. Scarce times cause pressure for many and test the mutual unity and solidarity of citizens. Economic imbalances are also tearing the European Union apart.

The big challenge for the next governments is to solve the problems of the sustainability gap. Finland must remain an attractive place to live, live, invest and raise a new generation. For example, in the field of energy technology, Finland has great potential. Unfortunately, there is little investment in the home country and the manufacturing industry is fading. The labor shortage also limits growth. The population structure weakens the economy and makes it difficult for the welfare state to function. We inevitably need more labor force from abroad as well. Working careers get longer, especially at the end. We encourage domestic ownership. Special attention must be paid to the state's ownership control.

We support maintaining the dividend deduction for unlisted companies. KD has promoted domestic ownership, e.g. by driving an investment savings account to Finland.

The focus of taxation must be gradually shifted from the taxation of work to the taxation of disadvantages. Income tax reductions must be targeted at low and medium incomes.

Internal security needs its authors Internal and external security are more and more closely part of the overall national security and preparedness. Overall safety and the cooperation of the various security actors must be taken care of at all levels. Internal security is also affected by the unity of society, a sense of belonging and basic security. The funding level of internal security operators must be fixed permanently. It is impossible to plan and develop operations in the longer term if funding has to be strained every year. Nowadays, there is a shortage of workers in almost all positions, from rescue operations to emergency center emergency responders. The workload of the police is increased by, among other things, the complexity of cases, the increase in gang violence, drug crime, internationalization and legislative changes. Russia's attack on Ukraine and the changes it brought with it have posed new challenges for the operations of the Border Guard. The transfer of the rescue operation to welfare areas must not weaken the operating conditions. Among other things, the funding shortfall consisting of service level deficiencies, the need to change the standby system, and furniture purchases must be covered. Bringing operational readiness to the level required by the Rescue Act requires a significant increase in both full-time employees and contract firefighters. Seamless cooperation between different authorities is needed to combat cyber and information influence. The same applies to preparing for crises and ensuring society's ability to function in disruptive situations.

Responsible immigration The goal of the Christian Democrats is a controlled, but fair and humane immigration policy. Finland needs workers and interaction internationally. More and more families have two homelands. Finns know how to empathize with other people's plight, as was seen when Russia attacked Ukraine. For our part, we are able to offer safety to those in need. The work-based immigration model requires development. The entry of top talent must be facilitated by speeding up permit processes.

Students must be encouraged to stay in Finland to work by automatically granting a work permit to graduated students. The consideration of labor availability must be gradually dismantled. Immigrants coming to low-wage fields must not create a new class of cheap labor in Finland. It is neither ethical nor sustainable in terms of social security spending. Although people from other countries are also needed to fill the lack of sustainability and labor shortage, the primary solution should be to get more of those already living in Finland to work. The basis of asylum and refugee policy is the equal and unconditional human dignity of every person. Finland must direct its aid to those who need it most. That is why we support the use of the quota refugee system as the primary means of providing security. Asylum policy requires international reform in the long term. It is not wrong to go in search of a better standard of living, but the system of international protection has not been created as a way to do so. We need better integration and carrots for integration, so that those who move to Finland from other places for various reasons find their place in our society. Poorly managed immigration and the increase in the number of people staying in the country illegally often lead to mild symptoms. In order to avoid Sweden's mistakes, housing policy must prevent regional concentration. Gang formation and lack of integration are best prevented by participation: everyone who moves to Finland for various reasons needs friends and contacts in Finnish society. Here, the third sector has a lot to offer. Language skills and education are the key to the job market. KD presents a language supplement to the labor market support, which encourages and rewards the rapid learning of Finnish or Swedish.

The environment and climate require action Life on Earth is an immeasurably great miracle. The Christian Democrats take climate change, the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of habitats seriously. Future generations have the right to life, clean food and the beauty of nature. Respecting nature is also about values and goals in life. A good relationship with nature is born in homes, schools and hobbies, starting with your own yard and the nearby forest, shopping and trash cans.

Local residents have the greatest interest and expertise in the protection of their immediate environment. It is important to take local opinion into account, for example, in mining issues. The European Union plays a significant role in setting environmental protection standards. For example, by banning the use of harmful chemicals in the EU, the state of the environment can be affected globally. Globally, up to a million species are threatened with extinction, especially in the tropics. Finland and the EU can combat species loss in the tropics, for example, by further reducing the import of soy feed and meat. The effects of the EU agricultural policy's greening programs on the environment and biodiversity have instead been contradictory. Sustainable development is economic, ecological, social and cultural. Poor countries also have the right to development. Through development cooperation, Finland supports developing countries' environmental protection, food security and adaptation to climate change. Pollution knows no boundaries. More attention must be paid to the cleanliness of living environments, chemicalization and the use of pesticides, as well as animal rights, also in global trade negotiations. It is difficult to predict the effects and shelf life of chemicals in nature. The eutrophication of the Baltic Sea must be brought to an end. Environmental pollution has been significantly reduced in Finland, and the condition of inland waterways, for example, has improved as a result of determined work. Other countries around the Baltic Sea must also take the reduction of emissions from agriculture and fish farming seriously. New challenges are created by the pressure to increase mining operations and, for example, the so-called battery industry. for the needs of the green transition.

The Christian Democrats want to develop the union as a cooperation body of independent states. The fundamental difference in EU policy between the parties is that some want to strengthen central power and increase joint responsibility, while others, like KD, strive to preserve the independence of the member states and their own responsibility as far as possible. The Union must focus its activities on those matters where cooperation brings added value to national politics and not intervene in issues that are in the national decision-making power.

Good \\nfunctional capacity is essential for older people’s wellbeing and their ability to keep living \\nat home.\\nPhysical inactivity poses a major challenge for all Western countries. The wellbeing of too \\nmany Finns is threatened by inactive lifestyles, which lead to reduced functional capacity. \\nOnly one in three children and young people and one in four adults engage in enough \\nphysical activity to stay healthy. Around 40 per cent of students have a level of physical \\ncapacity that makes daily life more difficult. Insufficient physical activity affects people’s \\nability to study and cope at work.

Various programmes and measures have been implemented over the \\nyears, but a comprehensive and cross-administrative approach will be needed to reverse \\nthis trend.\\nResearch evidence on the effects of physical activity on health, wellbeing and functional \\ncapacity is undeniable.

Both electoral \\ndistricts will remain independent and their boundaries will not be changed. Their regional \\nidentity will also be taken into account. A similar practice would in future be applied to \\nother electoral districts where the number of Members of Parliament to be elected drops \\nbelow eight or below seven MPs. The decision on the electoral region model will be made \\nduring 2024, and the aim is to introduce the model in the 2031 parliamentary elections at \\nthe latest.\\nFacilitating voting and campaign work\\nThe Government will ensure the accessibility of polling stations and council meeting \\nrooms through legislation and enhanced guidance and training of local authorities. \\nPeople entitled to transport services will be granted the right to transportation to a \\npolling station to vote, and people holding political positions of trust and standing as \\ncandidates in elections will be granted the right to make a certain number of trips without \\nthis affecting their right to make other trips.
