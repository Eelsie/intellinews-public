            "Sub question: What are the key climate actions proposed in the Government program?\n",
            "Response: The Government program proposes several key climate actions. Firstly, Finland aims to increase its climate handprint and move towards carbon neutrality primarily through effective emissions reduction measures, increased carbon sinks, and innovative clean solutions. These solutions will replace those based on polluting energy sources and raw materials. Climate measures will be implemented in a sustainable and just manner, economically, ecologically, socially, and regionally. \n",
            "\n",
            "Finland also plans to promote measures that improve society's ability to adapt to climate change and strengthen cooperation with other Nordic countries related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. The government is committed to meeting emission reduction targets and moving towards carbon neutrality and carbon negativity without increasing everyday costs or weakening competitiveness. \n",
            "\n",
            "One of the priorities of the Government’s climate policy is the rapid development of solutions that reduce emissions and capture carbon in industry and energy production. The government will review the carbon neutrality strategy in connection with drawing up a new climate and energy strategy. \n",
            "\n",
            "The Government also plans to encourage the selection of clean solutions and take into account other environmental impacts, such as biodiversity and sustainable development. It will work with businesses and industries to promote the creation of a model for calculating positive climate handprints and set targets for increasing the positive climate handprint of Finnish exports. \n",
            "\n",
            "Lastly, Finland's climate policy will be determined by agreements at the EU level, and the country will actively promote impactful and cost-effective climate and industrial policy within the EU. The government emphasizes the importance of cost-effective and technology-neutral emissions reduction measures and will take action to develop the pricing and markets of carbon emissions and sinks.\n",

            "for newborns. We’ll improve the preconditions of ownership by launching a national ownership program.  6. We will fix traffic connections everywhere in Finland. Functional connections within and from Finland are vital in terms of economic growth and security of supply. We’ll pay off repair debt on road and rail networks and see to sea and air connections. We’ll enable functional regional trains in new urban areas, develop faster rail connections, and promote competition in rail traffic. 7. We will take up on the opportunities of digitalisation and data econ-omy. We’ll push growth by promoting the data skills and digitalisation of SMEs, as well as investments in fast connections, research and product development. We’ll make sure we have nation-wide communication infra-structure. We’ll improve public services through digitalisation and provide data on the public sector to support the creation of new innovations. 8. We will reform the housing policy in Finland. We’ll reduce homelessness by reserving publicly funded rental housing to those who need them the most. We’ll control the cost development of housing by increasing the supply of plots and housing. We’ll reform the housing allowance system and land use and building regulations. We’ll increase cooperation between government and cities. 9. We will improve the competitiveness of Finnish food production. We’ll ensure the security of supply and food security. People must have safe, healthy and sustainably produced Finnish food available to them. Agricul-ture must be developed to become more competitive and viable and be more based on entrepreneurship. We’ll improve the preconditions of food and foodstuff export. 10. We will ensure the sustainable use of natural resources. Responsible forestry and circular economy offer solutions for fighting climate change and increase well-being everywhere in Finland.  2. We will stop living on borrowed money The National Coalition Party is striving for a Finland where the financing for a welfare state is secured for generations to come. We want to balance public finances without increasing the total tax rate. We wish to strengthen economic growth and create new jobs, increase productivity in both the private and public sectors, as well as prioritise and decrease public expenditure.  The 10-point worksheet of the National Coalition Party:  1. We will balance public expenses and revenue. We’ll write an economic recovery programme lasting two parliamentary terms to balance public finances in Finland and stop indebtedness by 2031.\n",

We will increase the share of population with higher education. By 2030, 50% of the population will have a higher education degree. We’ll allocate more available student places to areas with the highest lack of skilled workers. 5. We will reform the distribution of work, profiling and cooperation between universities and polytechnics. We’ll encourage universities and polytechnics to find the fields where they can aim to be the best in the world. We’ll strengthen the autonomy of higher education institutions through capitalisation. We’ll enable more individual learning paths, flexible paths to working life, and work-based learning. 6. We will increase funding for science and research. We’ll implement a programme, lasting one parliamentary term, where the capital of higher education institutions consists of billion Euros of public funding and at least half a billion of private funding.  7. We will increase the share of research, development and innovation funding to 4 per cent of the GDP by 2030. We’ll adopt an extensive right to RDI tax deductions for businesses, which will increase the number of RDI investments in companies. 8. We will make education more international. We’ll grant graduates of higher education a two-year residence permit so they can apply for work. We’ll increase the number of international students in upper secondary education and thus ensure their language skills and integration into Finnish society from an early age. 9. We will improve the operating conditions of culture and creative econ-omy. We’ll develop cultural export and tourism and strengthen the cultural sector in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.   10. We will improve the preconditions of sports and exercise. We’ll support the health and well-being of people by promoting a physically active lifestyle. The preconditions of elite sports will be improved in cooperation with the business sector. 6. We will increase well-being in Finland and prevent marginalisation The National Coalition Party wants a Finland that treats well children, the youth and working age people as well as the elderly.

New challenges are created by the pressure to increase mining operations and, for example, the so-called battery industry. for the needs of the green transition. Responsibility cannot be avoided by moving industry and food production from Finland to countries with weaker environmental standards. In climate protection, emissions must be viewed as a whole. Carbon and biodiversity calculations must take into account the entire life cycle and global effects. In addition to emissions, operational reliability and self-sufficiency must be taken into account in future energy solutions. In addition to curbing climate change, action must be taken to adapt to the changes. Reducing the use of fossil fuels is central to curbing climate change. Finland must not have to pay for the energy policy mistakes of the most prosperous European countries, and our forests must not become a compensation reserve for Central European industry. We do not support income transfer elements such as the climate action social fund. Energy and forest policy must continue to be the responsibility and decision-making power of the EU member states. It makes no sense to build Finland twice. Construction uses half of the world's non-renewable natural resources and generates almost half of all waste. During construction, attention must be paid to life-cycle emissions, repairability, indoor air safety and crisis resistance. Forest policy must improve the diversity of forests. We support sustainable forestry and promote additional funding for the voluntary protection of forests and other natural sites. Efforts must be made to care for and protect habitats in order to prevent the endangerment of species and to restore the vitality of already endangered species. Abundant and vibrant animal populations are not only the goal of conservation but also a prerequisite for hunting.

            "Life on Earth is an immeasurably great miracle. The Christian Democrats take climate change, the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of habitats seriously. Future generations have the right to life, clean food and the beauty of nature. Respecting nature is also about values and goals in life. A good relationship with nature is born in homes, schools and hobbies, starting with your own yard and the nearby forest, shopping and trash cans. KD's approach to environmental protection is based on the principle of close responsibility: responsibility cannot be outsourced to transnational actors. Cross-border challenges, such as climate change, must be answered through cooperation between countries. Local residents have the greatest interest and expertise in the protection of their immediate environment. It is important to take local opinion into account, for example, in mining issues. The European Union plays a significant role in setting environmental protection standards. For example, by banning the use of harmful chemicals in the EU, the state of the environment can be affected globally. Globally, up to a million species are threatened with extinction, especially in the tropics. Finland and the EU can combat species loss in the tropics, for example, by further reducing the import of soy feed and meat. The effects of the EU agricultural policy's greening programs on the environment and biodiversity have instead been contradictory. Sustainable development is economic, ecological, social and cultural. Poor countries also have the right to development. Through development cooperation, Finland supports developing countries' environmental protection, food security and adaptation to climate change. Pollution knows no boundaries. More attention must be paid to the cleanliness of living environments, chemicalization and the use of pesticides, as well as animal rights, also in global trade negotiations. It is difficult to predict the effects and shelf life of chemicals in nature. The eutrophication of the Baltic Sea must be brought to an end. Environmental pollution has been significantly reduced in Finland, and the condition of inland waterways, for example, has improved as a\n",
